# Twitter Scraper
The goal of this repository is to build a struct to extract data from the Twitter (or any data source) save in an HDFS (Hadoop) to be processed by Spark cluster. For this task, it was used the reference of many different repositories such as [Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), [Big Data Europe](https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hadoop-spark-workbench) and [bitnami](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/spark) (Spark).

In this repo you gonna find a similiar structure like this picture:
